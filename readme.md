# A Quick And Simple C++ Template With Cmake!
This is a quick and easy template for C++ and Cmake. It preconfigured cmake with required configurations to build an CLI
app.

To use this template, just clone it down and open it and run cmake on it. You may need to change the project name
inside.

example:
```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/kelvinchin12070811/simple-cpp-cmake-template.git <project_name>
```

or with ssh:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 git@github.com:kelvinchin12070811/simple-cpp-cmake-template.git <project_name>
```

Then delete the .git folder inside and start with your own via `git init`, optional to remove this readme too.
